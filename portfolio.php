                        <p>I am an artist and architect at heart, and I think that my technique and precision come to life in the web browser. I started my career as a graphic designer, and a few years later discovered that I have a knack for CSS, controlling the layout and design. Many projects have exposed me to different launguages and challenges, making me the (Awesome!) all-around web developer that I am today.</p>
