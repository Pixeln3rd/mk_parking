                            <p>Railbaron is an old board game that a couple of my friends play, I would always hear them complain about how long it took to do all the calculations they had to do while following a tiny chart printed on a faded piece of cardstock. Using jQuery UI and PHP, I developed a calculator so that within 2 taps they can do the math right on thier smartphone. Less Math. More Game.</p>
